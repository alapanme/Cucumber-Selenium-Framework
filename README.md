# Cucumber-Selenium-Framework
- A Selenium Web driver Framework using Page Object Model with Cucumber

# Some Generic description about the framework: 
- Chosen maven with cucumber and JUnit. Cucumber allows us to automate test cases in BDD format and with maven maintaining any dependencies is hassle free.
- Created the framework for two browsers for now keeping the option to add as many browsers as we want in the future.
- Also, Implemented two modes of testing Local & Remote. Currently we are using local testing, but in future if we decide to use any tools like Browserstack, it can be easily plugged into our framework.
- All the data, locators are managed from a single location (Configuration.properties) which gives us a very high degree of maintainability and also updation of any data is hassle free; because we update at one place at the changes are reflected everywhere throughout the framework.
- Implemented a Page object model structure for the framework, so that its extensible by just adding any new pages/functionalities that are updated in the Application Under Test.

So, In conclusion; Cucumber understands Gherkin language, read Feature files and execute code written in Step Definition files with the help of Cucumber Options specified in TestRunner.

# Details about the Framework Components (one by one):
- src/main java -> dataProviders -> configFileReader - As the name suggests this is created to read all the data/configurations that are there in the properties file.
- enums -> DriverType - Hardcoding of the driver keywords. Currently it supports chrome & opera. We can add other values in future.
- enums -> EnvironmentType - Hardcoding of the environment type. Currently mentioned are Local & Remote. We can add other values in future.
- managers -> PageObjectmanager - The Page Object Manager is to create the pageâ€™s object and also to make sure that the same object should not be created again and again. But to use single object for all the step definition files.
- managers -> WebDriverManager - To make sure that our framework is flexible enough to use as many browsers as possible.
- pageobjects -> FeedbackSelectionPage / GenericFeedbackPage / SpecificFeedbackPage - These are java files containing methods of the user actions happening to that specific page. 
- runners -> Test Runner - Cucumber uses Junit we need to have a Test Runner class. This class will use the Junit annotation @RunWith(), which tells JUnit, what is the test runner class. It more like a starting point for Junit to start for executing the tests.
- stepDefinations -> Steps - An annotation followed by the pattern is used to link the Step Definition to all the matching Steps, and the code is what Cucumber will execute when it sees a Gherkin Step. Cucumber finds the Step Definition file with the help of Glue code in Cucumber Options.
- functionalTests -> FeedbackSubmissionTests.feature - This is where our BDD style Test cases are written in Gherkin language.
- configs -> Configuration.properties - All the data is managed at a single place for the framework.

# How to Run the Tests:
- Through CMD - Go to the Project from command prompt and use the command mvn clean test
- Through Test Runner - `Right click on Test Runner & Run As -> JUnit Tests`

# How to Run in Multiple browsers: 
- So we just have to change the browser and driverpath key from the properties file. I have kept the driver files inside the project so as to prevent any extra setups to run the tests.
